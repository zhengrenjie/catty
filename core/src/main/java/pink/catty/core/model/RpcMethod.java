   *
   * There are several timeout setting might be set at meantime such as RpcService setting,
   * RpcMethod setting and Endpoint(client & server) setting. If every timeout options are set,
   * Endpoint setting is the deadline, which means the timeout-event will be trigger when Endpoint's
   * timeout reached even though RpcService timeout-setting or RpcMethod timeout-setting is longer
   * than Endpoint's timeout. So I suggest you to set Endpoint's timeout longer than RpcService or
   * RpcMethod setting.
   *
   * When there are comparable setting of RpcService and RpcMethod, RpcService timeout-setting will
   * be the deadline.
   *
   * So, if you want the timeout-setting work well, Endpoint > RpcService > Method (timeout) will be
   * a great setting.
   *
   * And you should also be careful about "retry-strategy", when timeout triggered might cause
   * severe problems.
